# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Synthora is a Kiro extension that analyzes Git repository history to reveal code evolution, technical decisions, and predict risk zones. The tool transforms Git metadata into narrative insights using AI, helping developers understand codebase evolution and team collaboration patterns. This extension combines a Next.js web application with a Kiro extension to provide interactive visualizations and AI-generated stories about code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer joining an existing project, I want to see an interactive timeline of code changes, so that I can quickly understand the project's evolution and key milestones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension THEN the system SHALL display an interactive timeline of all commits in the repository
2. WHEN a user hovers over a commit point THEN the system SHALL show commit details including author, message, and files changed
3. WHEN a user clicks on a time period THEN the system SHALL allow zooming into that specific timeframe
4. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL filter commits by author, file type, or commit message keywords
5. IF the repository has more than 1000 commits THEN the system SHALL paginate or aggregate data for performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get an AI-generated story about a specific file's evolution, so that I can understand its purpose, major changes, and potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on a file in the Kiro explorer THEN the system SHALL show a "Tell me this file's story" context menu option
2. WHEN a user selects the story option THEN the system SHALL analyze the file's Git history and generate a narrative using AI
3. WHEN the story is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a dedicated panel with sections for creation, major changes, bugs, and recommendations
4. IF the file has no Git history THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
5. WHEN the story generation takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with progress

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tech lead, I want to identify code hotspots and high-risk areas, so that I can focus code review efforts and plan refactoring priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a repository THEN it SHALL calculate risk scores for each file based on change frequency, author count, and bug-fix correlation
2. WHEN displaying file metrics THEN the system SHALL show commit count, author count, total changes, and calculated risk score
3. WHEN a user views the file explorer THEN the system SHALL overlay a heatmap indicating high-risk files with visual indicators
4. WHEN a user clicks on a high-risk file THEN the system SHALL display detailed metrics and justification for the risk score
5. IF a file has a risk score above 0.8 THEN the system SHALL highlight it as critical risk

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to search for technical decisions and context using natural language, so that I can understand why certain architectural choices were made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a semantic search query THEN the system SHALL search through commit messages, PR descriptions, and code comments
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance and provide context snippets
3. WHEN a user clicks on a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant commit or file location
4. IF no relevant results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or broader queries
5. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL use AI embeddings to understand query intent beyond keyword matching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work seamlessly with my Kiro IDE workflow, so that I can access insights without disrupting my development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL integrate with Kiro's command palette and context menus
2. WHEN a user opens a workspace with a Git repository THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and offer to analyze it
3. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL not block the IDE interface and show progress in the status bar
4. WHEN the user switches between repositories THEN the system SHALL maintain separate analysis data for each repository
5. IF the repository is very large THEN the system SHALL perform analysis in background jobs to maintain IDE responsiveness

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see team collaboration patterns and knowledge distribution, so that I can identify knowledge silos and improve team coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing team collaboration THEN the system SHALL identify which developers work on similar files and components
2. WHEN displaying collaboration insights THEN the system SHALL show knowledge distribution across team members
3. WHEN a knowledge silo is detected THEN the system SHALL highlight files or components owned by single developers
4. WHEN showing team metrics THEN the system SHALL display contribution patterns, review participation, and cross-team collaboration
5. IF team data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for improving collaboration visibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to persist analysis results and provide fast access to previously computed insights, so that I don't have to wait for re-analysis on every session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is analyzed THEN the system SHALL store results in a local database for quick retrieval
2. WHEN opening a previously analyzed repository THEN the system SHALL load cached results within 2 seconds
3. WHEN new commits are detected THEN the system SHALL incrementally update the analysis without full re-computation
4. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup policies for old analysis data
5. IF the repository structure changes significantly THEN the system SHALL trigger a fresh analysis automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality and notify the user
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry automatically
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
