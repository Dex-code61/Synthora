# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive authentication system using better-auth with GitHub OAuth integration, email functionality via Resend, and robust form validation using modern React patterns. The system will provide secure user authentication, beautiful UI pages, and proper error handling across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my GitHub account, so that I can access the application without creating a separate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign in with GitHub" button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to GitHub's OAuth authorization page
2. WHEN GitHub authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL create or update the user's profile in the database
3. WHEN GitHub authorization fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user is successfully authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard
5. IF a user is already signed in THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from auth pages to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive email notifications for authentication events, so that I can be informed about account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully signs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL send a welcome email via Resend
2. WHEN a user signs in from a new device or location THEN the system SHALL send a security notification email
3. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not block the authentication process
4. IF email configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error without breaking authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with beautiful and responsive authentication pages, so that I have a pleasant user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits authentication pages THEN the system SHALL display modern, responsive UI components
2. WHEN a user interacts with forms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
3. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the authentication pages SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
5. IF the user's browser supports it THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations and transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate error pages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters an authentication error THEN the system SHALL display a custom error page with helpful information
2. WHEN a user tries to access a protected route without authentication THEN the system SHALL display an unauthorized page
3. WHEN a user visits a non-existent page THEN the system SHALL display a custom 404 not-found page
4. WHEN any error page is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide navigation options to return to the application
5. IF an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a generic error page with contact information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all forms to use proper validation with zod and react-hook-form, so that data integrity is maintained and user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits any form THEN the system SHALL validate input using zod schemas
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages using react-hook-form
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL process the form submission
4. IF server-side validation fails THEN the system SHALL display server errors in the form
5. WHEN a user types in form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use next-safe-action for server actions and next-zod-route for API routes, so that all data flow is type-safe and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating server actions THEN the system SHALL use next-safe-action with zod validation
2. WHEN creating API routes THEN the system SHALL use next-zod-route for request/response validation
3. WHEN invalid data is sent to server actions THEN the system SHALL return typed validation errors
4. WHEN invalid data is sent to API routes THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP error responses
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL catch them at compile time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to sign in again
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data
5. IF session data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL clear it and require re-authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want user data to be stored securely in the database, so that user privacy and security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL store only necessary user data from GitHub
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL use proper database constraints and validation
3. WHEN updating user profiles THEN the system SHALL validate all changes before saving
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN a user's GitHub profile changes THEN the system SHALL update the local profile on next sign-in
